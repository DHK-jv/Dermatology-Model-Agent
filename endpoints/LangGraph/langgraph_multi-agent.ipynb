    "- `supervisor` — individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.\n",
    "- `swarm` — agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.\n"
